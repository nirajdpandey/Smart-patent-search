<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to new hydantoin derivatives, a process for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing the derivatives as active ingredients, particularly remedies for treatment diseases caused by stress.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In the current community of advanced civilization, stress due to human, internal or external causes are increasing. We suffer from complicated various diseases caused by the stress. As the causes of stress, there may be mentioned physical stimuli such as cold, noises and radiation, chemical stimuli such as deficiency in oxygen and chemicals (for example, ACTH and cortisone), biological stimuli such as bacteria and viruses and mental stimuli such as fear, anxiety and fretfulness. Many kinds of diseases are caused <!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->by the stress mainly in autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">It is well known that if those kinds of stress are not relieved properly by the protective controlling actions of the living body but they become chronic or they are fixed, there arise secondary adaptation diseases such as hypertension, nephrosclerosis, rheumatism, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Selye reported that as adaptation syndromes, the following phenomena arise:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
<li>1) Hypertrophy of adrenal cortex,</li>
<li>2) Atrophy of thymus and lymphatic tissue, and</li>
<li>3) bleeding from or ulcer of the inside wall of the stomach and intestines.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Various remedies for relieving the stress which causes the above mentioned various diseases have been developed. However, those remedies have demerits. For example, meprobamate used as an anti-anxiety agent is accompanied with addiction to drugs to cause convulsion and disturbance of consciousness as abstinence symptoms. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide have the same demerits as above. Therefore, parting from those drugs is one of medical problems.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a remedy useful for the treatment of diseases caused by stress and free from side-effects.</p>

<p id="p0009" num="0009">After intensive investigations on various hydantoin compounds having substituents at 5-position, the inventors have found that some 5,5-disubstituted hydantoin compounds having at least one substituted phenyl group at 5-position have pharmacological effects remarkably effective against diseases caused by stress, particularly sedetive, analgesic, antiulcerogenic, prolongating of sleeping a time and anti- hypertensive effects. It has also been round that the compounds of the present invention act in cedative on the central nervous system in contrast with DPH which stimu- lately affect the central nervous system as anticonvulsants and that the former compounds have pharmacological effects utterly different from those of DPH as will be understood by pharmacological tests given below.</p>

<p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, the present invention provides a process for introducing hydroxyl group into phenyl group at 5-position of hydantoin, which process comprises dealkylating or dearalkylating the compounds of the present invention wherein the phenyl group at 5-position of hydantoin has alkoxy group or aralkyloxy group according to a known method per se. This process is particularly recommended when various by-products are formed and isolation or purification of the object compound is difficult during the preparation of the object compound from the ketone of formula (III) wherein the phenyl group has hydroxyl group, which is a starting material for preparation of the compound of the present invention. Namely, the compound of the present invention can be prepared by forming a compound of the invention from an alkoxy- or aralkyloxy- <!-- EPO <DP n="16"> -->substituted starting ketone (III) by the above described process and, if necessary, dealkylating or dearalkylating the compound to form hydroxyl group so as to prepare other' compounds of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The dealkylation reaction can be carried out in a relatively short period of time, for example, by reacting the compound with anhydrous aluminum chloride in a substantially water-free solvent such as benzene or toluene.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The dearalkylation reaction can be carried out by reacting the compound with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst.

<p id="p0029" num="0029">The compounds of the present invention can be isolated or purified by a usual method. The object can be attained by reprecipitation and/or recrystallization by using a proper solvent. In addition, proper treatments such as decolorization may be effected.
