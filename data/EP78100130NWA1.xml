<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a hydroalkylation process, a composition useful as a catalyst in said process and a method for producing said composition.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Prior art catalysts in the field of hydroalkylation processes suffered from several drawbacks. These deficiencies of the prior art catalysts for the hydroalkylation reaction included: (1) The use of support materials for certain catalysts which are not able to withstand the temperatures employed in a typical air burn-off regeneration operation. Such regeneration operations are commonplace in the catalytic art for hydrocarbon conversions of various typea and it is highly desirable that the catalyst for the hydroalkylation process be stable to auch typically employed regeneration conditions. (2) In the hydroalkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons to cycloalkyl aromatic hydrocarbons, a problem in terms of aelectivity to the desired product is often evident. For example, in the conversion of benzene to cyclohexylbenzene, by-products such as cyclohaxane and mathylcyclopentylbenzene as well aa dicyclohexylbenzene and other heavier molecules can often be produced in such quantities that the pro- cass can become uneconomical. Thus, a more selective hydroalkylation catalyst is desired with little or no decrease in catalyst activity. It is, however, recognized that a decrease in catalyst activity can often be tolerated if there <!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->is a concomitant increase in selectivity to the desired product. (3) A number of the catalysts of the prior art for the hydroalkylation reaction are prepared by very complex and time consuming processes. For example, starting with a powdered crystalline zeolite support, said support is cation exchanged, washed and then incorporated into a matrix of another material such as silica-alumina. This combination is calcined, cooled, and impregnated with certain metal salts. Finally the composite is extruded into pellets and the like. Thus, it is de- sirabla that a more simplified and less expensive process for making active and selective catalysts be found. (4) Certain catalysts of the prior art for the hydroalkylation reaction were of fixed acidity because of the type of support material utilized. This left little variation that could be made in this/ important property of the hydroalkylation catalyst. It is therefore desirable that catalysts be developed which are varied easily in their acidity characteristics.</p>

The acidity of the above composition is assily adjusted by varying the conditions under which the cation exchange step ia carried out, such as, for example, adjusting the concentration of an ammonium compound in the cation exchange solution.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Detailed Description of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The composition of the instant invention can be briefly described as a platinum impregnated crystalline zeolite which has been cation exchanged with rare earth, nickel and ammonium compounds, calcined either before or after the platinum impregnation step and followed by contacting the platinum impregnated zeolite with a halogen-containing compound. It was discovered that the presence of the halide in a relatively small amount as compared to the total weight of the catalyst significantly increases the selectivity of the catalyst to produce a cycloalkyl aromatic hydrocarbon when the catalyst is used to hydroalkylate aromatic hydrocarbons as compared to the same catalyst without the halide component. Generally the presence of the halide component reduces the activity of the catalyst somewhat, but generally the increase in selectivity more than compeensates for the reduction in activity. Although not absolutely necessary, it is preferred that the above catalyst be treated with hydrogen prior to introduction of the aromatic hydrocarbon feed in the hydroalkylation process because of improved results.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The campositions of the instant invention are useful as catalysts and to soma axtant solve or obviate each of the above-mentioned deficiencies of the prior art catalyst. For example, the supports utilized for the compositions of the instant invention are stable to regeneration conditions uti- lized/under typical air burn-off operations; they appear to operate at higher <!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->levels of productivity in that they show a higher degree of activity and selectivity than certain of the prior art catalysts; the process of making the compositions of the instant invention is simple and straightforward and the compositions thus obtained should be less expensive than those of the prior art which utilize very complex steps in their preparation; and the compositions of the instant invention can be made with a high degree of flexibility in the degree of acidity simply by adjusting the cation exchange conditions on the crystalline zeolite support utilized for the compositions of this invention.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The support material for the composition employed in the instant invention is a crystalline zeolite which has been treated under cation exchange conditions with rare earth, nickel and ammonium compounds such that the cation metal content of the support is partially exchanged. Generally the cationic metal is an alkali metal which is sufficiently removed by cation exchange such that the remaining alkali metal content after the cation exchange step ranges from about 0.01 to about 2 percent by weight; however" the runs carried out in accordance with the invention and reported herein indicate that good results can be obtained when the alkali metal content of the cation exchanged zeolite ranges from about 0.1 to about 1 percent by weight. Some of the more commonly employed crystalline zeolites which are suitable for use in accordance with the present invention are the Type X or Type Y crystalline zeolites which are sometimes called molecular sieves because of their essentially uniform pore diameters. Some suitable Type Y synthetic crystalline zeolites are described for example in U.S. Patent 3,130,007 and some suitable Type X zeolites are described in U.S. Patent 2,882,244. Such materials are presently commercially available as for example zeolites SK-40 (Type Y) and 13X (Type X) from the Linde Division of Union Carbide Corporation, New York, New York.</p><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The alkali metal form of the crystalline zeolites usually comprises sodium as the alkali metal and said zeolites are treated under cation exchange conditions with a mixture of rare earth, nickel and ammonium compounds in accordance with the present inventioa in order to provide a suitable support material for use in the preparation of the compositions of the invention.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">It is contemplated that any of the readily available rare earth metal compounds may be employed in the cation exchange solution. Generally, the compounds used are those in which the rare earth natal-containing ion is present in the cationic state. Representative rare earth metal compounds include nitrates, bromides, acetates, chlorides, iodides, sulfates and mixtures thereof of one or more of the rare earth metals including cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. Compounds of the rare earths named above may be employed singly, however, it is often convenient to employ commercially available mixtures of the rare earths. For example, mixtures of rare earth metal compounds such as the chlorides of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, and gadolinium are available commercially at a relatively low cost and may be effectively employed.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">As noted above, the zeolite material is cation exchanged with a mixture of rare earth, nickel and ammonium compounds according to the instant invention. Any convenient ammonium compound may be employed although the chloride is preferred because it is inexpensive and readily available. The weight ratio of ammonium compound to nickel and rare earth compounds in the aqueous exchange solution can be selected over a broad range. Generally the weight ratio of ammonium compound to nickel and rare earth compounds combined is within the range of from about 0.5:1 to about 20:1, although the data con- taiDad herein indicates that a range of from about 0.2:1 to about 5:1 can be <!-- EPO <DP n="9"> -->used with good results. The concentration of rare earth compounds in the aqueous exchange solution can be varied over a wide range and exchange conditions can be adjusted accordingly such that the rare earth content of the ion exchanged crystalline zeolite can be selected over a broad range. Generally, the content of the final catalyst composite in terms of the rare earth ele- meats is from about 2 to about 25 weight percent. The runs described.herein indicate that the rare earth content of the catalyst can be within the range of from 5 to 20 weight percent. Good results were obtained employing a rare earth content of about 10 percent by weight. As noted above, the alkali metal content, for example sodium, of the exchanged catalyst support is partially removed by the ion exchange step and the alkali metal is generally from about 0.01 to about 2 percent by weight; however, the runs described herein indicate that good results can be obtained employing an alkali metal content ranging from about 0.1 to about 1 percent by weight.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The nickel compounds which will be employed in admixture with the above-named rare earth metal compounds and ammonium compounds are those wherein the nickel ion is present in the cationic state. some suitable compounds representative of the nickel compounds which can be used in the invention include the nitrates, bromides, acetates, chlorides, iodides, sulfates and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The nickel content in the final composition can also be selected over a broad range. Generally the composition will comprise from about 0.01 to about 15 weight percent nickel, although the runs carried out in accordance with the invention and described herein indicate that good results can be obtained employing a nickel content ranging from about 1 to about 8 percent by weight of said composition.</p><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> -->
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The procedure whereby the Type X and Type Y zeolites are treated with aqueous solutions of rare earth, nickel and ammonium compounds to replace a portion of the alkali metal content of the zeolite is a cation exchange pro- cesa which can be carried out in a batch or continuous fashion. Generally the exchange process is carried out on a continuous basis under the following typical conditions. A fixed bed of the zeolite material is treated with said aqueous solution of the rare earth, nickel and ammonium compounds at a tamper- ature of 90 to 110°C, under conditions such that from about 0.1 to about 0.5 of the volume of aqueous salts solution per volume of zeolite is in contact with said zeolite per hour or, in other words, an LHSV ranging from about 0.1 to about 0.5 is employed in the exchange process. Under these conditions, the exchange process can be completed in 48 hours or less to achieve the de- aired level of rare earth, nickel and ammonium ions in the zeolite. The exchanged zeolite is then washed free of excess ions from the exchange step with water. The excess wash water is removed by drying the zeolite at a temperature ranging from about 100°C. to about 300°C. just prior to calcination. The instant catalyst can be calcined before impregnation with the platinum compound to be described below or the impregnation can be carried out prior to the calcination step. In either case, the calcination is carried out by slowly heating the zeolite from about 100 to 300°C, to a temperature within the range of from about 200 to about 550°C, in order to calcine the zeolite and convert the ammonium cations to the hydrogen form. Usually, the calcination is conducted until a constant weight is obtained for the zeolitic material, generally from about 2 to about 10 hours. The calcined zeolite is then cooled in ambient air, i.e., under conditions of normal humidity.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The above-described support is impregnated with a solution of at least one platinum compound followed by evaporation of the solvent used in the <!-- EPO <DP n="11"> -->impregnation step. Evaporation of the solvent can be conducted under vacuum if desired. Suitable solvents include water, alcohols, such as ethanol, ketones, such as acetone, and the like. Some of the various platinum compounds that can be employed in the impregnation step are as follows: ammonium hexa- chloroplatinate(IV), ammonium tetrachloroplatinate(II), chloroplatinic acid, diaminoplatinum dinitrite, platinic acid, platinum tetrachloride and mixtures thereof. The impregnation is generally carried out under what may be called "total impregnation" whereby the entire solids in the solutions used in the impregnation are left on the catalyst support and the liquid solvent for said compounds is simply removed by evaporation.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The platinum content in the final composition can be selected over a broad range. Generally the platinum content ranges from 0.01 to about 1 percent by weight of said composition although the runs described herein indicate that good results can be obtained employing a platinum content within the range of from about 0.05 to 0.25 percent by weight of said composition. :</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The halogen-containing compounds which can be utilized according to the instant invention as a source of halide include the elemental halogens / themselves such as fluorine, bromine, chlorine or iodine and the hydrohalides of said elements (HF, HBr, HGl and HI). Use of the above compounds generally requires careful control of the addition, and it is preferred to employ organic compounds which contain halogen in the instant invention. A wide variety of halogen-containing organic compounds can be employed to provide the necessary halide for use in the instant invention. These compounds can contain one or more atoms of fluorine, bromine, chlorine or iodine or mixtures thereof per molecule and the carbon content of such compounds is generally in the range of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms per molecule. For example, such compounds include alkyl halides, acid halides, or fully halogenated carbon compounds such as carbon tetrachloride or tetrachloroethylene and the like. <!-- EPO <DP n="12"> -->Examples of other suitable organic compounds which can be employed include chloroform, bromoform, dichloromethane, dibromomathane, difluoromethane, chloromethane, bromomethane, 1,4-dichlorobutane, 1,4-dibromobutane, 1-chlorobutane, 1-fluorobutane, 1-bromobutane, 1,2-diehloroethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, 2-chloropropane, 2-bromopropane, acetyl chloride, acetyl iodide, acetyl bromide, bromochloromethane, 1-bromo-4-chlorobutane, 1,2-dichloroethylene, 1,2-dibromoethylene and mixtures thereof. From the results of the runs disclosed herein, it is believed that organic compounds containing chlorine or bromine will produce the best results and thus such compounds are preferred.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The hydroalkylation catalysts are modified with a halide source compound according to the instant invention by simply adding said halide source compound to the catalyst prior to or simultaneous with contacting the aromatic hydrocarbon feed in the hydroalkylation process. Because such small amounts of the halide source compound are employed, one method for adding the halide source compound to the catalyst which has been very satisfactory is to dilute the halide source compound with the aromatic hydrocarbon feed and thus contact the catalyst with the feed simultaneously with the halide source compound. It is presently believed that the halogen component of the catalyst which has been treated with the halide source compound exists in the halide form and thus is referred to herein as a halide, but the exact form of the halogen component of the catalyst has not been investigated and is not to be a limitation on the invention.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The amount of the halide added per gram of catalyst utilized is an important aspect of the present invention because too much halide will poison the catalyst whereas too little halide will not improve the selectivity of the catalyst to the desired cycloalkyl aromatic hydrocarbon. Thus, the halide content of the composition is that amount sufficient to improve the selectivity <!-- EPO <DP n="13"> -->of the composition to the desired cycloalkyl aromatic hydrocarbon. Generally, the amount of halide added to the catalyst ranges from about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams of elemental halogen per gram of catalyst; however, based upon the results of the runs described herein, it is expected that the amount of halide added to the catalyst will more often range from about 0.5 to about 10 milligrams of elemental halogen per gram of catalyst.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The addition of the halide source compounds to the aromatic hydrocarbon feed stream can be utilized when the catalyst is fresh, i.e., previously unused, or can also be utilized after one or more regenerations of the above-mentioned catalyst. As most of the runs described herein indicate, a fresh catalyst is improved somewhat by regeneration and in many cases it may be desirable to subject a fresh catalyst to the regeneration process prior to using it. A typical regeneration procedure for the above-described catalyst includes purging the system of hydrogen with an inert gas such as nitrogen, then allowing air to enter the reaction zone and heating to a range of 400-500<sup>*</sup>C. in the presence of flowing air and maintaining this temperature in the presence of flowing air for a total time of about three hours. The catalyst is then cooled in the presence of flowing air or nitrogen and at a temperature of about 200°C. is reduced with hydrogen for a period of about 0.5 to 1 hour. The catalyst is then cooled to the desired reaction temperature and is then ready for use in the hydroalkylation reaction. Generally, it is desirable to retreat the catalyst with the halogen-containing compound after each regeneration process to insure that the catalyst will provide the highest selectivity to the desired cycloalkyl aromatic compound.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Although the compound or compounds which serve as the source of halide to modify the hydroalkylation catalyst of this invention can be added to the hydrocarbon feed in one portion; good results were obtained by adding <!-- EPO <DP n="14"> -->the halogen-containing compound to the feed over a period of time, generally from about 1 to about 3 hours although longer times can and were employed. It is believed that a more efficient utilization of the halide source compound is achieved by the above-described gradual addition of said compounds to the catalyst, such as when that halide source compound is added to the hydrocarbon feed, but in some instances a shorter catalyst modification time may be more desirable and produce an equal or superior catalyst.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The composition described above is employed for the hydroalkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons to produce cycloalkyl aromatic hydrocarbons. Some of the feedstocks which are suitable for use in the present invention are aromatic compounds, i.e., monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Some specific examples of these are benzene, toluene, xylenes, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The aromatic hydrocarbon feedstocks should be essentially free of sulfur-containing compounds and other known poisons for hydrogenation catalysts in general. However, it is believed that a small amount of water, e.g., 5 to 100 ppm, in the feedstock is beneficial for maintaining catalyst activity over an extended period, e.g., several days.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The invention is particularly valuable for the conversion of benzene to cyclohexylbenzene. Cyclohexylbenzene is known as a valuable solvent and chemical intermediate. It can be converted in high yield to phenol and cyclohexanone by autooxidation with subsequent acid treatment. It ia also useful as an intermediate in the production of cyclohexene which in turn can be utilized for the production of adipic acid and caprolactam.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The aromatic hydrocarbon feedstock is fed to the catalyst in a reaction zone operated under a wide range of conditions. The feedstock liquid hourly space velocity (LBSV), reaction temperature and pressure, and the hydrogen feed rate are not particularly critical; however, the liquid hourly <!-- EPO <DP n="15"> -->space velocity (LHSV) generally ranges from about 1 to about 100, the reaction pressure generally ranges from about 690 to about 13,800 kPa (about 100 to about 2,000 psig), the hydrogen feed rate generally ranging from about 0.2 to about 1 mole per mole of aromatic hydrocarbon feedstock per hour, and the reaction temperature generally ranging from about 100 to about 250<sup>*</sup>C. Based upon the runs described herein good results can be obtained employing a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) within the range of from about 5 to about 30, a reaction pressure within the range of from about 1,380 to about 6,900 kPa (about 200 to about 1,000 psig), the hydrogen feed rate within the range of from about 0.2 to about 1 mole per mole of aromatic hydrocarbon feed per hour, and the reaction temperature within the range of from about 140 to about 200<sup>*</sup>C.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The hydroalkylation reaction is conveniently carried out by having the above-described catalyst in a fixed bed reactor and then contacting said catalyst with the aromatic hydrocarbon feed and hydrogen in an upflow or downflow arrangement. It is also possible to employ a countercurrent flow of hydrogen and the aromatic hydrocarbon feed over the catalyst in the reaction zone. It is also possible to carry out the hydroalkylation reaction under batch conditions although a batch process is less preferred because it is normally more expensive to operate and initial equipment costs are higher based upon the same size process.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Although a fixed bed reactor is mentioned above, most any type of reaction zone can be used as the particular type of reaction zone is not believed to be a critical parameter of the invention.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The reaction mixture from the reaction zone can usually be conveniently separated into the desired components by simple fractional distillation, and recycle of the unreacted feedstock and unreacted hydrogen can be accomplished as desired. The hydroalkylation products can be further purified as desired after separation from unreacted feedstock.</p><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> -->
<p id="p0037" num="0037">It is generally desirable to pretreat the catalyst with hydrogen gas prior to contacting the catalyst with the aromatic hydrocarbon in order to prereduce the catalyst. Based upon the runs described hereinafter, the hydrogen pressure and feed rate for the pretreating step generally is the same as that to be employed when contacting the aromatic hydrocarbon with the/catalyst. In the hydroalkylation runs of the examples hereinafter described, the catalyst in the reactor was first reduced at 150°C. for 15 minutes under 3,450 kPa (500 psig) hydrogen at a hydrogen flow rate of 0.32 liters per minute before benzene was introduced to the reactor. Hydrogen pressure during the hydroalkylation process was maintained at 3,450 kPa (500 psig) and at a flow rate of about 0.32 liters per minute.</p>

<heading id="h0004">Catalyst Preparation</heading>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The catalyst utilised in the runs of this Example, designated catalyst No. 1, was prepared in the following manner. A glass tube of 45 millimeter diameter, equipped with heating means and means for passing an aqueous solution of compounds therethrough, was charged with 200 grams of a type X crystalline zeolite (Davison 13X mole sieves of 8-12 mesh manufactured by Davison Chemical Division of W. R. Grace and Co., Baltimore, Maryland). An aqueous solution of 400 grams of ammonium chloride, 100 grams of rare earth chlorides, and 200 grams of nickel chloride (NiCl2) hexahydrate in 4 liters of deionized water was prepared. The rare earth chlorides were utilized as a commercially available mixture of the following composition: MCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O wherein M = lanthanum 23%, cerium 43.5X, praseodymium 5.4X, neodymium 17.9X, samarium 1.9X, gadolinium 0.6X, and others 0.2X.
