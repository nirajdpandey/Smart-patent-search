 This invention relates to 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone ultraviolet radiation absorbing compounds, to a process for preparing such compounds, to synthetic resins stabilized against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation by incorporating in such resins small quantities of such compounds, and to stabilizer compositions comprising such compounds in combination with a known polymer stabilizer. 
 Certain 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone compounds are known to be effective ultraviolet absorbers and light stabilizers, with the 2--hydroxyl group critically necessary for effectiveness. These are among a large number of classes of compounds disclosed in the patent ' literature as meeting the requirements for an effective ultraviolet radiation absorber. in lieu of individual references, the review by G. 2. Lappin in " Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology " (N. Bikales, ed. New York, John Wiley-interscience, 1971) Vol. 14, pages 125 to 148 can be consulted. 
 According to Lappin's review, the 18 2-hydroxybenzophenone compounds indicated to be in commercial use as stabilizers are low to moderate molecular weight compounds having a single benzophenone unit in the molecule. Lappin refers to problems of "compatibility" of the additive stabilizer with the polymer being stabilized, including such properties as the solubility of the additive in the polymer, the rate of diffusion of the additive through the polymer, and the rate of loss of the additive from the polymer. Lappin characterizes compatibility as " a sensitive function of molecular structure and not entirely predictable". Among attempts to improve on the commercially available 2-hydroxybenzophenones. Lappin indicates that longer outdoor life of polymers might be obtained with relatively high molecular weight ultraviolet radiation absorbers   EPO <DP n="3">  and states that attempts to utilize polymeric and polymerizable absorbers for this purpose had given ambiguous results and not been commercially successful. 
 Subsequent attempts to overcome the inadequacies of the conventional ultraviolet absorber stabilizers include a number of disclosures of 2-hydroxybenzophenones having either a plurality of benzophenone units in the molecule or functional group substitution in addition to hydroxyl and alkoxyl. Thus, Lappin in U.S. Patent 3,310,525 of March 21, 1967 disclosed alpha-omega-bis(2-hydroxybenzoyl)alkane stabilizers for polyesters and poly-alpha-olefin resins, having a formula
 wherein n is an integer in a range from 2 to 8, and X, Y and Z are independently selected from the group of hydrogen, C t -C 4  alkoxy and C t - C 4  alkyl radicals.
 
 H. Dressler in U.S. Patent 3,399,237 of August 27, 1968 disclosed ultraviolet light stabilizing derivatives of 4-benzoylresorcinol having the formula
 wherein Z is a member selected from the group consisting of sulfur and
 and R is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl having from 1-11 carbon atoms. 
 M. Minagawa in Japan Kokai 74 78,692 of July 29, 1974 disclosed 2-hydroxybenzophenone derivatives carrying cyclic imide substituents linked to the 4-position of the 2-hydroxybenzophenone by an alkyleneoxy group, for example 4-(2-phthalimidethoxy)-2-hydroxy- benzophenone. 
 M. Minagawa in Japan Kokai 75 74579 of June 19, 1975 disclosed 2-hydroxybenzophenone derivatives having from 2 to 7 hydroxybenzophenone units linked through such bivalent groups as methylene, methyleneoxymethylene, cyclohexylidene, sulfide, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, alkylidene, carboxyalkylidene, and carbalkoxyalkylidene, including for example methylenebis(2-hydroxy-  EPO <DP n="4">

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 In accordance with this invention a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkoxy group is caused to react with formaldehyde and an amine represented by the formula HNR 1 R 2 , In which R and R 2  taken together form a 5 to 6 member heterocyclic ring free of carbonyl groups and including the nitrogen atom, or are Independently hydrogen or alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, provided that R 1  and R 2  are not simultaneously hydrogen. 
 This reaction provides a novel 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethyl- benzophenone represented by Formula I.
 
 In which  R , R 1 , and R 2  are as defined above. 
 The new 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone is an effective stabilizer for polymers such as polyamides, polyesters both saturated and unsaturated, polyacetals, polyolefins, and polyurethanes, as well as a catalyst for the conversion of organic isocyanates to isocyanurates (i.e. trimerized isocyanates). The 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethyl-   EPO <DP n="5">  benzophenone can also react, suitably in the presence of an alkaline catalyst, with a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone or with itself to give a 5,5'-methylene bis(2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone) represented by formula II which can be recovered In high yield and purity while minimizing formation of less desirable isomers and by-products. Reactions for the preparation of a new 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-amino- methylbenzophenone (reaction A) and subsequent conversion to a 5,5'-methyienebis(2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone) (reaction B) can be written as follows:
 
 X is hydrogen or -CH 2 NR 1 R 2 . Thus, when X is hydrogen, reaction B is a condensation of 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone with 2-hydroxy-4 -alkoxybenzophenone to give 5,5'-tnethylenebis(2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone; When X is -CH 2 NR 1 R 2 , the reaction can be written as a dimerization of self-condensation of 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone (reaction C) to give 5,5'-methylenebis(2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone) as follows:  EPO <DP n="6">  
 When the 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone used in reaction A with amine and formaldehyde to make the 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzo- phenone is different from the 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone used in the condensation reaction B with the 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethyl- benzophenone to give the methylene disubstituted benzophenone product, there can be obtained in an unambiguous and selective manner an unsymmetrical bis-benzophenone of the formula:
 
 in which R and R' are dissimilar alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, as illustrated by the following reaction sequence using first 2-hydroxy-4-n-oxtoxybenzophenone in the aminomethylation reaction, followed by the condensation of the aminomethyl derivative with 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone: .
  EPO <DP n="7">  
 When a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone is used as a polymer stabilizer to protect a polymer against the harmful effects of light of wavelength less than 400 nanometers, effective concentrations In the polymer range from 0.01 to 1% by weight of the polymer being stabllized. Known polymer stabilizers can be used in combination with a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone of the invention in proportions of 0.1 part of known stabllizers up to 10 parts of known stabilizer per part of 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone.

 A compound of ASS resin, 100 parts, zinc stearate 0.5 part, 4,4'--thiobis(2-t-butyl-5-methylphanol) 0.2 part and 5-diethylaminomethyl--2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone was milled and molded to obtain a sheet 3mm thick. On portions of this sheet the tensile strength before and after Irradiation for 800 hours in the weatherometer was measured. 
 The above composition had superior retention of tensile strength compared to a control composition lacking the 5-diethylaminomethyl-2--hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone of this invention. 
 EXAMPLE- 9 
 A compound of high density polyethylene 100 parts by weight, calcium stearate 0.3 parts, distearyl thiodipropionate 0.2 part and 2-hydroxy-4-n-octoxy-5-dimethylaminomethylbenzophenone 0.1 part was milled and compression molded to give a sheet 0.5 mm thick. Portions of the sheet were exposed to the radiation of a weatherometer until embrittled. 
 The above composition outlasted a control composition made without the 2-hydroxy-4-octoxy-5-dimethylaminomethylbenzophenone.
